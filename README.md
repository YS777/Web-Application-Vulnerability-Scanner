# Web Application Vulnerability Scanner


This project is a Python-based tool designed to scan web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF. It automates the process of testing these vulnerabilities and generates a basic report.

## Features
- SQL Injection Detection:- Scans for SQL injection vulnerabilities by testing form fields and URL parameters.
- XSS Detection:- Injects JavaScript payloads to check for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
- CSRF Detection:- Analyzes forms for missing anti-CSRF tokens.
- Directory Traversal:- Attempts to access directories outside the web root.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/YS777/Web-Application-Vulnerability-Scanner.git

2. Navigate to the scanner directory.
cd web-vulnerability-scanner/scanner

3. Run the scanner.
python scanner.py [target_url]

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced reporting with detailed explanations.
- Support for more vulnerability types.
- Integration with external databases for more extensive testing.
