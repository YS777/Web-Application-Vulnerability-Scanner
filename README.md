Web Application Vulnerability Scanner

This project is a Python-based tool designed to scan web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF. It automates the process of testing these vulnerabilities and provides basic security insights.

Features

SQL Injection Detection: Scans URL parameters and form fields for SQL injection vulnerabilities using GET and POST methods.
XSS Detection: Injects JavaScript payloads to check for Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
CSRF Detection: Analyzes forms for missing anti-CSRF tokens.
Error Handling: Improves robustness by handling HTTP request errors gracefully.
Directory Traversal: Attempts to access directories outside the web root.

How to Use

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YS777/Web-Application-Vulnerability-Scanner

Navigate to the scanner directory:

cd web-vulnerability-scanner/scanner
Run the scanner:

python scanner.py [target_url]

Future Improvements
Enhanced reporting with detailed explanations.
Time-based SQL injection detection.
Support for more vulnerability types.
Integration with external databases for more extensive testing.
